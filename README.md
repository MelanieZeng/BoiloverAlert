# BoiloverAlert
Smart kitchen solution: a boil-over alert that notifies people when their cooking soup is boiling over the pot.

I designed an IoT object for my mom since she encounters a lot of problems with housework. When she makes porridge and soups, the simmering process usually lasts for 2 – 3 hours. What makes her frustrated is that there are lots of foam (scum and fat) in the meat soup which always boil over the pot if she doesn’t skim it off as soon as possible. It always makes a mess in the kitchen and lead to potential fire risks. Therefore, I proposed to make a “Boil-over Alert” that can alert her as soon as the bubbles and foam rise close to the pot surface, so that she can scoop them off quickly without waiting in the kitchen the whole time.

The Boil-over Alert has a sensor that senses the liquid level of the soup and an indicator to give her an alert on time. I chose to use a soil moisture sensor instead of a temperature sensor because the soup flowing over the pot can happen before, during or after boiling, so a soil moisture sensor will be more accurate to capture the boil over moment. Both a LED light and a text message will be the indicators so that she can be alerted no matter where she is at home and whether she is paying attention on something else or not. After she skim off the foam, she can press a button to turn off the LED light.
